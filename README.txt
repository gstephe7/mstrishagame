## How To Play

### Moving
Use the arrow keys to move your player.

### Scoring Points
Eat unhealthy foods in order to score points. In order to eat food, move your player to the location of the food. Eating healthy foods (apples and sushi) will result in point reductions.

Points are as follows...
<ul>
  <li>Pizza: 1 Point</li>
  <li>Garlic Bread: 2 Points</li>
  <li>Zaxby's Chicken Finger Plate: 2 Points</li>
  <li>Pasta: 3 Points</li>
  <li>Cookie Dough: 4 Points</li>
  <li>Apples: -1 Point</li>
  <li>Sushi: -4 Points</li>
</ul>
